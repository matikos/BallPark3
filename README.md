This is a baseball game simulator, meant as an exercise in complex logic in C#.
I used various MLB stats from mid 2019 and constructed a algorith to mimic chances of a hitter hitting and getting to a base or scoring a point.
Screen output still need tweaking. Next big step is having it written in Swift.
